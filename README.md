### Request to Join

Use the following template to prepare and [send us an email](mailto:trimble-oss-contrib-admins-ug@trimble.com) with you request to join the Trimble GitHub organization and enterprise.

```text

Dear Trimble GitHub Enterprise Administrators,

I have added the GitHub - Trimble application to my Okta account. Please grant access for my GitHub account:

<@yourgithubaccount>

{ Tell us a bit about yourself and your role at Trimble. }

I am joining because I...

{ desire to contribute to a particular repository or initiative, such as Trimble Modus. }
{ desire to join an existing organization within the Trimble GitHub enterprise. }
{ etc. }

Thanks,

{your name}

```

[^1]: **Update**: It is now recommended that you create a Trimble specific GitHub account rather than using an existing personal GitHub username. This is particularly important if you want to use GitHub Copilot as using a personal GitHub account risks combining personal data and business data.
