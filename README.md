Dear Trimble GitHub Enterprise Administrators,

I have added the GitHub - Trimble application to my Okta account. Please
grant access for my GitHub account:

{ @yourgithubaccount }

{ Tell us a bit about yourself and your role at Trimble. }

I am joining because I...

{ desire to contribute to a particular repository or initiative, such as Trimble Modus. }
{ desire to set up an organization within the Trimble GitHub enterprise. }
{ desire to join an existing organization within the Trimble GitHub enterprise. }
{ etc. }

Thanks,

{your name}

```

[^1]: You can use a personal GitHub account or create a work specific one, it's up to you. Trimble SSO will work with either.
